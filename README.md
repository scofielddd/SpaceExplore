### **A VR Space Exploration Experience**

## **Introduction**
**SpaceExplore** is a VR project designed to provide users with an **immersive space exploration experience** focused on relaxation, discovery, and seamless planet landings. Inspired by open-world games like *Forza Horizon* and *No Man‚Äôs Sky*, this project enables users to **freely control a spaceship, traverse planets, and experience atmospheric landings**.

Built using **Unity 3D**, the project utilizes the **Meta XR Core SDK** and **Meta XR Interaction SDK** to ensure **smooth VR interactions, joystick-based spaceship controls, and realistic environment transitions**.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/SpaceExplore.git
cd SpaceExplore
```
### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages**
Make sure you have Unity 2021.3+ (LTS recommended) installed.

#### **Import Meta XR SDKs**
You will need the following Meta XR packages for VR interactions and tracking:
- **Meta XR Core SDK:** Provides tracking, camera rig, and movement capabilities. 
  [Download Meta XR Core SDK](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/downloads/package/meta-xr-core-sdk/)
- **Meta XR Interaction SDK:** Handles controller input, UI interactions, and object grabbing. 
  [Download Meta Interaction SDK](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-isdk-interaction-sdk-overview/)

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Import Project Assets**
Due to size and licensing restrictions, the following asset files are not included in this repository. Please obtain them from the Unity Asset Store:
- **Spaceship:** [Star Sparrow Modular Spaceship (Free)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/star-sparrow-modular-spaceship-73167)
- **Universe Background:** [Deep Space Skybox Pack (Free)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/deep-space-skybox-pack-11056)
- **Multi-Planets Texture:** [Procedural Planets and Stars (Not Free)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/substances/procedural-planets-and-stars-106662)

After obtaining these assets, import them into Unity via the Package Manager or the Asset Store.

## **üåå Implementation Details**

### **VR Tracking & Spaceship Control**
The project uses Meta XR Core SDK to set up the OVR Camera Rig and Tracking Space for accurate head and hand tracking. Spaceship navigation is implemented using `OVRInput` and `Rigidbody` physics.

### **Seamless Planet Landing System**
The landing system evolved through several methods:
1. **Large Sphere Inside the Planet:** Initially used but found impractical for VR scaling.
2. **Scene Transition at Altitude Threshold:** Effective but caused abrupt changes.
3. **Hybrid Approach:** Combines atmospheric fading via a shader with a gradual scene transition.

### **Atmosphere Shader (Fading Effect)**
The shader‚Äôs opacity is controlled by adjusting its properties based on the spaceship's altitude.

## **üéÆ How to Play**
- **Launch the Game:** Start the project in Unity and launch the game in VR (compatible with Meta Quest 2/Pro).
- **Control the Spaceship:** Use the joystick to navigate the spaceship through space.
- **Planetary Landing:** As you approach a planet, watch the atmosphere gradually fade. Press "B" for auto-landing, or manually descend to land.
- **Explore:** Once landed, explore the planet's surface or take off again to resume space travel.

## **üìå Next Steps**
Future Features:
- Expanding to more planets with unique landscapes.
- Adding space stations for mid-space exploration.
- Implementing real-time voice communication in VR.
- Enhancing terrain details for improved realism.
